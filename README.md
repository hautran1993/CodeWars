This repo has a bunch of Code Wars problems explained in detail, geared towards beginners in Java Script.

The exercises folder has a fundamentals folder with problems.js (for jus the practice problems without the solutions), and the solutions.js (for the solutions to each problem explained in detail along with solution variations).

The questions.txt are questions I had about certain problems/methods.

Terms.txt are a few terms with resources I find helful.

This repo will continually be a work in progress!
